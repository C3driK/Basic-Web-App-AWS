# Basic-WebApp-AWS

I built a simple webapp on AWS, connected the WebApp to a serverless backend and then finally I added some interactivity with an API and Database.

The AWS service I used to complete the project include:
 - AWS Amplify
 - Amazon API Gateway
 - AWS Lambda
 - AWS IAM
 - Amazon DynamoDB
The cost implication of carrying out this project was 0$ as all the resources used are Free Tier eligible.

The project is divided into 5 modules:
- Create Web App
- Build Serverless Function
- Link Serverless Function to Web App
- Build Data Table
- Add interactivity to Web App.
At the end this is what the application architecture should look like "link"

# Create WebApp
